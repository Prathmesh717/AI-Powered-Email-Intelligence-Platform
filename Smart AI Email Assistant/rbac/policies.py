"""RBAC policy definitions — role → allowed permissions, route → required permission.

Hardening (SECURITY_AUDIT.md API5):
  - Every route exposed by the API is mapped here. Unmapped requests are
    denied by RBACMiddleware (fail closed).
  - Longest-prefix match in the middleware so /workflows/{id}/trace doesn't
    inherit /workflows's broad "read:workflows" grant.
  - 'service' role is for service-to-service JWTs (sub starts with "service:");
    it intentionally does NOT carry *:* — pick the precise permissions.
